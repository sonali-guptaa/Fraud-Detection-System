# Fraud Detection System
This project tackles the critical challenge of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities within financial transactions or systems. By leveraging the power of advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a robust fraud detection system capable of distinguishing legitimate user behavior from fraudulent attempts.

# Key Concepts and Challenges
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior within data.
- Machine Learning Models: Employing algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks for predictive analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features to enhance fraud detection accuracy.
- Real-time Monitoring: Implementing systems that can detect and respond to fraudulent activities in real-time.
- Scalability: Designing fraud detection systems capable of handling large volumes of transactions efficiently.

# How To Run
- Clone this repository.
- Install the required libraries.
- Run the "Fraud Detection.ipynb" script to train the fraud detection model.
